`op_expr x` referring to the infix operator(s) with a precedence of `x`.
`op_expr (x <- 1..n) := op_expr (x - 1) <op x> op_expr (x - 1)` meaning that the definition of operator number `x` is a pair of a decrement lower operators ( or `low_expr` in the case of `op_expr n`, the highest precedence operator(s) ) surrounding the symbol for the given operator(s).
